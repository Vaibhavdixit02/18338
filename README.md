## Lecturer: Prof. Alan Edelman

This is the repository for public materials for the MIT course 18.338, *Eigenvalues of random matrices*, for the Fall 2022 semester.

## Location and Time
The class will be held at 2-139 from 3--4:30pm every Monday and Wednesday. 

## Course Description:

We focus on the mathematics of random matrices - from the finite to the infinite, and beyond.

Our emphasis will be on interplay between the varying mathematical tools that have come to play in the modern understanding of random matrix theory. We will also discuss applications of random matrix techniques to problems in engineering and science.

Additional topics will be decided based on the interests of the students. No particular prerequisites are needed though a proficiency in linear algebra and basic probability will be assumed. A familiary with numerical computing languages such as Julia, MATLAB, or Mathematica may be useful .... our primary focus will be Julia and some Mathematica.

This is a graduate course that is intended to be flexible so as to cover the backgrounds of different students. Generally grading will be based on satisfactory completion of problem sets and projects or equivalents.  Homework will be peer graded, and we will look to a rotating student for solutions.

## Homeworks

There will be a few homeworks to start class off including access to the course textbook (being written) where comments are being asked for.

## Projects

Please check out [the list of possible class projects](https://github.com/mitmath/18338/blob/master/project_lists.pdf). You are also welcome to work on your own topic. On the second and fourth Fridays, @ 3-4pm, Sungwoo will have office hours for class projects. Students are strongly encouraged to talk to Sungwoo before the end of September, if they are looking for a class project topic. 

There will be a project proposal (maybe a page) due Oct 26 and short 3-minute midterm presentation (project proposal) on 10/31.
The proposal should have references, a short computation or a bit of mathematics or both, something to show that you are on your way.


A full project report is due is 12/14.
